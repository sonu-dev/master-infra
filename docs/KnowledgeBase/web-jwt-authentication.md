- Open Standard: Means anywhere, anytime, and anyone can use JWT.
- Secure data transfer between any two bodies, any two users, any two servers.
- It is digitally signed: Information is verified and trusted.
- There is no alteration of data.
- Compact: because JWT can be sent via URL, post request & HTTP header.

- Self Contained: because JWT itself holds user information.
